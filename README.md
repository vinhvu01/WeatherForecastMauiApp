# WeatherForecastMauiApp

The following is an app written in the MAUL app for educational purposes. It calls Weather API (www.visualcrossing.com) to get weather forecast information for specified cities, and locations.

The Visual Crossing Weather API provides developers with weather data for any programming language or script. The Weather API provides instant and scalable access to historical weather reports and forecast data in an easy-to-use JSON or text format. See https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api for more information and additional documentation, sample code, and use cases.

To sign up for a free account to view, download weather data, and build weather API queries, see https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather/weather-data-services

Documentation for the Weather API can be found at https://www.visualcrossing.com/resources/documentation/weather-api/weather-api-documentation/. The documentation of the available data on weather elements and their values can be found at https://www.visualcrossing.com/resources/documentation/weather-data/weather-data-documentation/.
